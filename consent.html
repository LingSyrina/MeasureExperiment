  <h3>Why is this study being done?</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this study is to examine how what people have learned can influence how they think, perceive, act, and make decisions.  This study is basic research in the area of cognitive psychology that focuses on learning and cognition. </p>

  <h3>What will happen during the study? </h3>
    <p>If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things:</p>
    <p> You will be seated at a computer.  You will be presented with several straightforward tasks to complete.  These tasks will include responding with keystrokes to stimuli (e.g., images, videos, words, or sounds) presented on the computer and may involve learning what categories objects belong in, determining if objects are identical or related, or remembering or transferring what you learn about objects in one training task to a related task.  The experiment lasts for 20 minutes to 60 minutes, and this single session is the entire participation duration.  If you are participating in the experiment in our laboratory, then you will participate in the experiment within a private cubicle in the Geology Building of Indiana University.  If you are participating in the experiment online, then you can participate wherever you wish.</p>
